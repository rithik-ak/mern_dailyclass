    <p>
        Loki moved silently through the forbidden wing of the Grand Archive, a place even the Allfather preferred to ignore. 
        His emerald cloak trailed behind him like a whisper, brushing against shelves carved with runes older than Asgard itself.
        He had spent centuries searching for a purpose that wasn’t handed to him as an afterthought, and tonight he believed he
        had found it. Nestled beneath layers of dust lay a tome wrapped in serpent-scaled leather. The moment he touched it,
        power rippled through his veins, sharp and exhilarating.
        Inside, he discovered the prophecy of a cosmic rift—an unstable fracture capable of merging timelines into one chaotic
        existence. The idea thrilled him. If the multiverse could be reshaped, then so could Loki’s destiny. He imagined 
        future where he wasn’t merely Thor’s troublesome brother or Odin’s burden, but a ruler of something far greater than Asgard.
        Yet beneath that ambition lingered a quieter thought: perhaps this was his chance to redefine who Loki truly was.
        He closed the book with a decisive snap. Whatever destiny intended, he would bend it to his will. And for the first 
        time in centuries, he felt the spark of something dangerously close to hope.

    <h1 id="ch2">Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>
        The cosmic rift hovered above the rocky cliff like a shimmering wound in the sky, pulsing with 
        unstable energy. Loki approached cautiously, enchanted daggers ready at his sides. The closer he stepped,
        the louder the multiverse’s whispers became—echoes of countless Lokis from timelines where he ruled,
        perished, or redeemed himself. Each voice carried both promise and threat.
        Then one figure emerged from the swirling light: a variant Loki, older and battle-scarred,
        yet with a calm confidence Loki rarely saw in himself. “This power isn’t what you think,” the variant warned.
        “It consumes. It rewrites. It erases.”
        Loki sneered. “I’ve spent lifetimes being rewritten by others. Why not let me decide the next version of myself?”
        The variant stepped closer, eyes filled with a weary understanding. “Because once the rift chooses you,
        there is no turning back.”
        Their gazes locked—one Loki hungry for transformation, the other desperately hoping to stop him.
        The wind howled around them as the rift expanded, its colors shifting like a storm.
        Loki felt both fear and exhilaration burning in his chest.
        Was this destiny offering him a crown… or a prison stitched from every possible version of himself?
    </p>

    <h1 id="ch3">Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>
        
        The rift flared as Loki raised his hand, arcane energy crackling around his fingertips. The power beckoned him like a throne waiting to be claimed. He felt the multiverse tug at him, promising untold possibilities—empires ruled, battles won, identities remade. It tempted every fractured piece of his ego and every wound he’d never admitted still hurt.
        But then, memories flickered: Frigga’s gentle smile, Thor’s relentless belief in him, Mobius’s stubborn trust. Moments when someone had looked at him and seen more than a villain.
        For once, Loki didn’t mask the conflict inside him. He could seize the power and become a god beyond gods… or he could choose something far more difficult: restraint.
        With a sharp exhale, he stepped back. “I choose myself,” he whispered—not the version written by fate, nor the one expected by others, but the one still becoming.
        The rift screamed before collapsing into a silent spark, drifting into nothingness.
        The variant Loki smiled with relief. “You did what none of us ever could.”
        Loki rolled his eyes. “Don’t make it sentimental.”
        Yet as he walked away from the cliff, he felt lighter—freer.
        For the first time, Loki wasn’t running from destiny. He was rewriting it.
